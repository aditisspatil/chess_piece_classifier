# Chess Piece Classifier
Image Classification project using transfer learning.
This is an image classifier for chess pieces, which takes an image of chess piece and predicts its name as king, queen, rook, bishop, knight or pawn.
 
I have added 2 versions of notebook, to ensure the rendering. 
The bigger verion has image outputs, and hence bigger size, which is not redered on GitHub.
The smaller verion only contains image of confusion matrix, and it is loaded properly.

This project is based on [fastai notebook](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson2-download.ipynb)
I have also referred [Ken Jee's Notebook](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) to understand usage with Google Colab.

## Data
I have created the data set myself by taking screenshots of chess sets from google and [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/home).
